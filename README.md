Note:

1. The python file is based on the Google Colab platform. If you need to run it on the 
local python compiler, you should change the file path!

2. The test dataset prediction results of the two models were saved as csv files as
"pred_Bayesian" and "pred_LDA", respectively.

3. The two prediction results show similar distribution while Bayes decision rule seems
a little better than the Fisher discriminant analysis.
